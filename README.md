## Responsive Portfolio

The objective of this project was to create a personal portfolio with a responsive design using the Bootstrap CSS Framework.  In order to accomplish this, both Bootstrap's grid system and components were used.

Bootstrap components used: 
- Navbar
- Card
- Form
- Button

In future updates I would like to:
- Include links and images from my personal projects
- Include links to my social media (including LinkedIn)
- Make the contact page functional so I will receive submitted user information and messages
